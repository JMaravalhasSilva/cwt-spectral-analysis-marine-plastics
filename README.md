## Wavelet-Based Discriminant Feature Analysis of Marine Plastic Litter Spectra and Matching via Magnitude Gradient Cosine Similarity

This repository contains the scripts and data accompanying our paper, submitted to the Oceans 2025 Great Lakes Conference.

 - ``plot_cwts.m`` - generates the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) scalogram plots.
 - ``compare_cwts.m`` - computes CWTGM similarity scores and produces the table included in the paper.
 
The preprint version of the paper is included in this repository.

### Requirements

 - MATLAB R2025a.
 - Wavelet Toolbox.

### Datasets

This repository includes a ``Datasets`` directory containing the spectral data used in the paper. Each dataset is in its own subdirectory, which includes a README with details about the data, preprocessing scripts, and dataset licensing.

### Licensing and Code Reuse Policy

All files except for the original datasets are licensed under the MIT license (see ``LICENSE`` file). If you use this software, original or modified, to generate results for a published paper or presentation, please ensure the release of the source code and data used to produce those results.

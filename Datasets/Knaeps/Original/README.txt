
1. Introductory information
* Title of the dataset: Hyperspectral reflectance of marine plastics in the VIS to SWIR 
* This dataset consists of 47 hyperspectral reflectance measurements of plastic litter samples.  It contains the mean and standard deviation of all measurements.
* Naming convention: 
o For plastic specimen: name_state_depth_TSM, 
with name the name of the plastic specimen, state is d(dry), w(wet) or s(submerged), the depth specified in cm below the surface and TSM measured in mg L-1. 
For example, OrangePlacemat_s_4_200 refers to measurements of an Orange placemat submerged at 4 cm depth and a concentration of 200mg L-1 TSM.
o For measurements of the water in the tank: Water_tank_TSM
With TSM measured in mg L-1.

2. Methodological information
Spectral reflectance of the plastic targets was measured with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec 4.
Data collection consisted of spectral reflectance measurements of different plastic specimen, both virgin plastics as real plastic waste samples from the Port of Antwerp. 
Measurements of the spectral reflectance were performed at two locations. The first is an optical calibration laboratory at VITO, Belgium. The laboratory was used to perform spectral reflectance measurements of the dry plastics. The second is a water tank at Flanders Hydraulics facility in Antwerp.
